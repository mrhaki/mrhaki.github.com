title: mrhaki.com - Java/Groovy Developer
---

Hello. I am a passoniate Groovy and Java developer based in Tilburg, The Netherlands.
My goal is to write software, like Pixar makes movies, BMW makes cars,
Bang & Olufsen makes audio and TV systems and Apple makes computers and devices:
clean, elegant, user-centered and high quality.

My name is Hubert A. Klein Ikkink. Not a very common name, right?
To make things easier I just picked the first letters of my firstname and surname
and came up with haki. So there you have it, now I am known as Mr. Haki or mrhaki for short.
